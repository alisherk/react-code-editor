iframes 
can load entite html docs like this: 
<iframe src='test.html'/>

enable comms between parent and child 
can write down "parent" inside of child and reference parent context

from parent we can access child like this: 

document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.<prop>

iframe settings: 
Direct access between iframes is allowed when iframe element does nott have a sandbox property 
or has sandbox="allow-same-origin" property

<iframe src='/test.html' sandbox='' /> would disallow access via parent

<iframe src='/test.html' sandbox='allow-same-origin' /> would allow access

access is not allowed when requests come from different domains or ports

const html = `<h1>hello </h1>`
<iframe srcDoc={html} /> allows to assign local doc to iframe


code /etc/hosts 
127.0.0.1 nothing.localhost => will treat it different domains
